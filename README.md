The code below can be found in src/index.js 

```js
const clientId =  'ClientID';
const DiscordRpc = require('discord-rpc');
const RPC = new DiscordRpc.Client({transport: 'ipc'});

DiscordRpc.register(clientId);

async function setActivity() {
    if (!RPC) return;
    RPC.setActivity({
        details: "Your description Here.",
        state: 'Your detail Here.',
        startTimestamp: Date.now(),
        largeImageKey: 'logo1',
        largeImageText: "Your logo's name Here.",
        smallImageKey: 'logo2',
        smallImageText: 'Your logo's name Here.',
        instance: false,
        buttons: [
            {
                label: 'Button name Here.',
                url:'Button URL Here.'
            },
            {
                label: 'Button name Here.',
                url:'Button URL Here.'
            }
        ]

    })
}

RPC.on('ready', async () => {
    setActivity();
})

RPC.login({ clientId }).catch(err => console.error(err));


console.log("[START] Discord RPC with Server Count started!")
```

## Getting Application ID & Adding Assets
In order to get the Application ID, you need to login to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers). After logging in, create an Application by clicking on 'New Application' button given on top right, next to your logo.

After creating a new application, name it what you want.
> **Note:** The application's name will be in your status like: *Playing* ***Application Name***.

After naming make sure to copy the Application ID and paste it in the place of "Your Application's ID Here." in index.js.

After that, go to the 'Rich Presence' tab on the left navbar. [(Screenshot)](https://forum.cfx.re/uploads/default/original/3X/b/c/bca411d7b51bf613247873d39194255605e3e688.png)

Inside 'Rich Presence' tab, scroll down to 'RICH PRESENCE ASSETS' [(Screenshot)](https://forum.cfx.re/uploads/default/original/3X/c/a/cae8666cda59131cdb35a32e6802c4c31d9af5d6.png) and add any Image there (could be your logo). After adding, make sure to note down the Image's name u add (you can also change the image's name after uploading).

After uploading the logo, click on save and return back to app.js and replace "logo2" and "logo1" with the logo name you have added in the Portal.
